What is Python?
      High-level: Easy to read and write.
      Interpreted: Runs line-by-line without compilation.
      Dynamically typed: No need to declare variable types.
      Cross-platform: Works on Windows, macOS, Linux.

__**__Comments__**__

--> Python has commenting capability for the purpose of in-code documentation.

--> Comments start with a { # } , and Python will render the rest of the line as a comment:

Comments in Python:

#This is a comment.
print("Hello, World!")


Note :- We Can Use ' + ' for String Concatenation.
