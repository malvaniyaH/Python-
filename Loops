__**For Loop**__

A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).

This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.

With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.

Syntex 
        FOR Var IN Stored_variable :
              Statements

Ex 
    data = ["H" , "A" , "R" , "S" , "H" , "I" , "L"]

     for x in data:
        print(x)

OUTPUT :- 
H
A
R
S
H
I
L 

__**WHILE**__

 A while loop in Python repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a given condition is True.

Syntex:-
              while condition:
                 # code block

condition: A boolean expression evaluated before each iteration,If the condition becomes False, the loop stops.
Be careful to update variables inside the loop to avoid infinite loops.

Ex 
  
l=1
while l<=10:
    print(l)
    l+=1

OUTPUT:-
1
2
3
4
5
